# application.properties/.yml
#     can either be .properties or .yml but has to be named application and be in src/main/resources
#
#     here you can put properties your project uses
#       if your project changes environments - these properties will stay the same



# you DONT actually need these things for your project - this is just an example of how this file works
spring:
  application:
    name: hello-spring-boot   # sets the name for the project
    admin:
      enabled: false          # this is the default value - enable admin privileges - only change if u know what you're doing
  config: 
      name: application       # this is the default value - this sets the name for your config file - only change if u know what you're doing
  
  output:
      ansi:
        enabled: ALWAYS       # lets your terminal display colors
server:
  port: 8282                  # sets the project port number - 8080 is default


# below is the syntax for .properties

# spring.application.name=hello-spring-boot
# spring.application.admin.enabled=false
# spring.config.name=application
# server.port=8282
